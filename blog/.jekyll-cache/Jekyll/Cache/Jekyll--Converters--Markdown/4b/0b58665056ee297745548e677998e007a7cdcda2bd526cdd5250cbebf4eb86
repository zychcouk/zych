<p>Starting a genealogy tree is not an easy task. If You’re anything like me you may feel intimidated and not sure where to start. If you would tell me a year ago that my tree will have 800 entries in a space of 12 months I would have not believed you for a second. But as hard as it may seem at the start, it only gets easier once you have some basic information.</p>

<p>Continue reading to find out where to start what to do first and what to look out for when when trying to create your tree.</p>

<h1 id="where-to-start">Where to start</h1>

<p>Starting off in the world of genealogy can be overwhelming and it is much of a information gathering exercise than anything else. Before you dive deep into old documents and archives you should get some basic information and timing is crucial here too.</p>

<p>You don’t even need any software or websites yet, so instead off looking at different services I would first recommend the following:</p>

<h2 id="check-if-anyone-did-it-already">Check if anyone did it already</h2>

<p>From my experience people like to boast about how they did family research in the past or how they did it for school project with their kids and obviously they found that your famous grand uncle fought in some war. When you actually go and try to get some useful information from them it turns out that the tree is lost or never existed in the first place. This was pretty much the case with me when I wanted to dig into our family history but heard so many stories that it was already done. No point in doing it again I thought. So I contacted my relatives and boy was I wrong, it turned out that nobody could give me any information whatsoever.</p>

<h2 id="phone-people">Phone people</h2>

<p>Surprisingly the most difficult part of finding your roots is to break through the barrier of the first 100 years.</p>

<p>I will speak from my own experience and I did most of the research on Polish websites but I imagine it will be the same for most of the other countrie as well.</p>

<p>Surprisingly the most difficult part of finding your roots is to break through the barrier of the first 100 years. There is an abundance of records and information dating from before 1920. After this it’s fairly easy if you know the place and a type of document you are looking for.</p>

<p>The truth is that everybody just loves taking about themselves. I not had one Grandma or Aunt that would not take the opportunity to tell her life story with great detail.</p>

<p>First step would be then phoning all of the relatives you can phone oldest ones first.This may seem a bit odd and uneasy depending how close you are with them and how comfortable the idea seem and how extravert you are, but just wait until you ask.</p>

<p>The truth is that everybody just loves taking about themselves. I not had one Grandma or Aunt that would not take the opportunity to tell her life story with great detail. You can take notes of all the anecdotes and interesting stuff but there key info to write down is his/hers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Place and date of birth</li>
  <li>Place and date of birth of relatives</li>
  <li>Any burial places of relatives</li>
</ul>

<p>Even if they can’t remember the exact date of birth or death of your relatives the burial place will be crucial here as you can extract these from there.</p>

<h2 id="graves-can-help-you-pass-the-first-100-years">Graves can help you pass the first 100 years</h2>

<p>At the start I have extracted a lot of dates from online photos from cementaries. If you know the name of the person and the place of their burial you can pretty much be sure that the dates are right as long as there are no two people with the same name there. The advantage here is that you can get exact date of birth which can be useful to find the birth certificate if you know the birth place but not sure of the date.</p>

<p><a href="https://billiongraves.com/">https://billiongraves.com/</a> - this is the obvious one to visit in the first instance but you need also Google for local ones depending on the location you’re looking for.</p>

<p>Your goal here and only useful info apart from maybe finding your relatives grave location is finding the exact date of birth. You can mix and match info here. If you don’t know the exact cemetery try finding the exact death date and look over all the entries that match.</p>

<h2 id="google-is-your-friend">Google is your friend</h2>

<p>There is no better feeling than finding something about your family that no body knew yet.</p>

<p>You would be surprised how much you can find with Google nowadays, using simple operators like must include or excluding results can get you far. Google as well as most digital libraries can nowadays search through texts of scanned PDF’s so most of archive newspapers are now searchable. I used this method to find some of the amazing rare finds in my library.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use “” to do the must include</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use -word (minus sign) to exclude something. Great if you are getting to many results back.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Big advantage is to know specific events that can help you look out for people. One example in Poland is “The Polish Declarations of Admiration and Friendship for the United States” this is a collection of 111 volumes of signatures and greetings presented in 1926 to President Calvin Coolidge to commemorate the 150th anniversary of U.S. independence and to acknowledge American participation and aid to Poland during World War I.</p>

<p>I found first mentions of my relatives surnames in this book in the borders of today’s Ukraine which back then was part of Poland. This gave me confirmation in which area should I look as well as a desire carry on the reaserch.</p>

<p>There is no better feeling than finding something about your family that no body knew yet.</p>

<p>Google can reveal surprising information even if other websites don’t yield any results</p>

<p>The other amazing discovery was that somebody have put some of my great grandmother documents for sale on an action, I considered buying it but it was to expensive but the auction house included scans of documents including marriage certificate that I could not find anywhere else.</p>

<h1 id="choose-your-sitetools">Choose your site/tools</h1>

<p>I have used the following since I started and these are my thoughts:</p>

<p><a href="http://familysearch.org">familysearch.org</a> - amazing free site with unbelievable catalog of certificates where I found majority of old documents for free. I did not like the experience of building your family tree and the fact that it is a sort of a collective effort so anybody can change information you save. They need to provide explanation and it is traceable but there is no way to stop that as far as I can tell. Overall great resource for information not great to save it, I would say.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.geneanet.org/">https://en.geneanet.org/</a> - This is the service I fell in love with, easy to use great to build your tree and store documents, great overall discoverability so people can contact you. I did not find any useful info apart from other users trees but from what I can tell it has a big library of French documents so if that’s something you need maybe it is worth checking out. You can also upgrade to premium to support the service.</p>

<p><a href="https://gramps-project.org">https://gramps-project.org/</a> - As a Linux geek I also tried to use this obvious guy but it lacks the features that I needed like the ability to get discovered online and also to show my tree or documents when I am not on my personal laptop. So all the other online services did that better.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.myheritage.com/">https://www.myheritage.com/</a> - Another obvious one. This one is well known and is a bit pricey. I tried the full on membership but I am a bit disappointed. First of all the record search is amazing I would highly recommend getting that because it is by far the best for searching huge database of records and trees. The thing I was not sold on is the tree building experience itself. It did not look great and it was sluggish. Also contrary to what you may think I did not like the ability to instantly add whole branches of people to your tree. More on that down below. Over all great for documents and Not so great for discoverability as you can only message if you are a paid user. Well most of the things are hidden behind a pay wall with myheritage to be fair.</p>

<h1 id="the-further-back-you-go-the-easier-it-gets">The further back you go the easier it gets</h1>

<p>One thing to keep in mind is that it well only get easier once you go back a bit. It is fascinating how much records are actually available before the 1900. The most difficult part was getting the birth certificates from my local registrar to find out my grandfather name and my grandmother maidens name and other similar easy info but the problem is once nobody knows something you hit the wall.</p>

<p>In one instance the registrar didn’t even had a maidens name for one of my relatives and it was left blank. I later found it in old church certificates. You need to be flexible trying to fill in the gaps and everything will all fall into place eventually.</p>

<p>I also learned that it is always harder to find the father side of the tree for some reason. In my tree I got places where I am stuck around 1930 and just can’t go any further for now without more information or a visit to the birth town of the person.</p>

<p>That’s why the hardest to go through the first 100 years and after that all the certificates and documents are usually released and available online in different places.</p>

<p>I would also say it is great to publish your tree online so people can contact you and maybe provide some extra information that you are missing. Most of the websites have some build in privacy settings as well so it is fairly safe. In the end you are mostly gathering info that is already available online anyway.</p>

<p>If you are comfortable with the idea of publishing your tree online there’s a chance somebody will fill your gaps for you or contact you.&gt;</p>

<h1 id="things-to-be-weary-of">Things to be weary of</h1>

<h2 id="automatic-import-vs-hand-picking-information">Automatic import vs hand picking information</h2>

<p>I was quite looking forward for all the automatic discoveries that myheritage website offered but it quickly turned out that it is not great. There are two camps in genealogy research I would say. There are people that just hoard numbers and would add everything in. I extracted information from people that had 44k people in their tree. The other camp is to add only close relatives with hand picked and verified information. I quickly found myself to be the fan of the latter. My heritage helped me grow my tree from 500 to 800 hundred entries but all this was automatic discoveries and automatic import that quickly killed all the fun and joy of finding forgotten information yourself, a bit like a detective solving miseries and puzzles.</p>

<p>Also the discoveries were not closely related and not that important to me so overall I am not impressed. I will be migrating back to Geneanet and hand pick all the entries myself cuting down the branches further down the line that are not closely related. See below for more information on importing and checking documents.</p>

<h2 id="people-make-mistakes-when-indexing">People make mistakes when indexing</h2>

<p>When extracting information from sites indexed by volunteers or even from other people trees don’t always assume that the information is accurate and don’t take things for granted. I found out many times that these entries can have errors for different reasons. Best way is to always double check with document that you can find yourself. Even then I found couple of documents like original certificates from 1900 with some obvious mistakes so you can’t even assume that the documents back then we’re always typed out right.</p>

<p>Also for example, when I first started I had made some errors in my tree. I then went to fix them but in the meantime somebody with a huge tree just went and copied a branch out of my tree containing errors. I assume it will stay like that with the error burried in over 50k entries.</p>

<p>I now learned to double check everything I am adding to my tree.</p>

<p>Often you may find something related to your tree and lack the information to recognise that you actually found something useful.</p>

<p>On the other hand you can be lucky and may clarify some of the family stories and anecdotes. I been told an old story of six children dying in my wife’s side of the family in just one day. Finding old death certificates revealed that the death spanned over a course of a year of not one day. So be weary that not all you hear from your relatives may be accurate as well. People tend to mix facts and it is likely that you will need to look in different places for different documents. Sometimes in places you would not expect to find them.</p>

<p>I also found myself going back to old matches I disregarded because the town did not check out only to later find out that my family stayed there for a period of time. So often you may find something and lack the information the recognise that you actually found something.</p>

<h2 id="digging-in-the-dirt">Digging in the dirt</h2>

<p>One other thing I learned (first hand 😅) is that you might come across some touchy subjects while you do your research. You need to use your own judgement here to see if it worth asking your relatives or keeping to yourself.</p>

<p>It is usually obvious when you find something out of place like an odd birth certificate or a document showing that your Great grampa was away for 3 years when “his” son was born. You can totally find some weird information out there, it’s just a case of approaching it there right way.</p>

<h2 id="note-on-storing-documents">Note on storing documents</h2>

<p>Not sure how tidy you are with your documents on your PC but I would highly recommend to store the images and documents in some neat way to help search and retrieval when needed. Start straight away and stick with it even if you got a lot of documents to store away. It will save you the hassle later.</p>

<p>I am still to find my ideal way of storing my data but I initially went for folders with surnames every folder containing files named like so:</p>

<p>Full name - year - type of document</p>

<p>Also with females I always stick to maidens name just to be consistent.</p>

<p>I also used Digikam extensively for face tagging and mapping of old family photos I scanned onto my hard drive.</p>

<p>I might just write in more detail about it when exploring a better storage solution for my documents library.</p>

<h1 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h1>

<p>This research has been one of the most rewarding things I’ve done in my life and I am not even over exaggerating. It is one of the best natural ways to connect with your family. It gives you that easy taking point and excuse to phone if you need one. Great way to spend some quality time with your family talking about the past and learning more about their lives.</p>

<p>I encourage everybody to try it and see if you find anything exciting.</p>

<p>Also I feel like I got some expertise in Polish genealogy research so if you need any help drop me an email. You can also look out for a deep dive post into polish genealogy.</p>
